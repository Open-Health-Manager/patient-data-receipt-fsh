#### Push Notification

John Smith signs up for an online service called a Health Manager that promises to help him with his health and healthcare by tying together his health data in one place and giving him control over it, including the ability to correct, enrich, and share it. Upon signing up, Health Manager informs John that organization that collect his health data are required to make it available to him and that he can designate Health Manager as the recipient and custodian of his health data. John starts with his smart phone, which tracks some health data such as a activity and how much he uses his phone. The next time he visits his PCP, John asks about making this designation and successfully records Health Manager as the destination for data collected by his PCP. He gradually discovers other apps, services, and organizations that he interacts with are able to sent his data to his Health Manager and he signs as many of them up as he can.

In response, data starts flowing into his Health Manager. His smart phone provides a daily summary of his per-app usage of his phone and other movement data. Each time he sees his doctor or gets a test result, that information flows into his Health Manager as soon as it gets recorded. Other organizations provide additional health-related information, helping to build a detailed record of John's health all under his control and for his use.


#### Vaccine Cards & Proof of Immunization  

Besides their requirement in crossing international borders, vaccine cards in recent years have been used to screen entry into restaurants, entertainment venues, and other spaces where large numbers of people gather.  CDC Vaccination Cards provide a textbook example of a clinical receipt of having had a medical procedure performed that's in the interest to public health.


#### Secondary Consultations  

Similar to the proof of immunization, various out-of-network or out-of-pocket procedures may involve obtaining healthcare data from outside the established primary care environment and trust network.  These consultations can range from lab exams to consultations with specialists for rare conditions.  At the end of the visit, a diagnosis or prescription is sometimes given.  When signed (either cryptographically or via signature), the resulting document acts as a clinical data receipt, suitable for being excused from work or school, and usable as evidence in a court of law.  

#### Over the Counter Purchase Receipts

Professional clinicins spend a disproportionate amount of their time managing controlled substances and performing procedures that cary a risk of bodily harm if done incorrectly.  However, for the patient, managing such activities is often a small percentage of their overall health management.  It's extremely common among the population as a whole, for the bulk of any individual's day-to-day healthcare spending to be on over-the-counter medications and supplies.  IRS and other organizations ask to see financial receipts when calculating medical expense deductions.  And from this branch of law can we understand over-the-counter purchase receipts as a form of data receipt for non-regulated or semi-regulated substances.  

#### Appointment Reminders   

A common practice at clinics is to have a stack of blank business cards that are designed as appointment reminders.  The receptionist or scheduling manager is typically tasked with filling out an appointment reminder card and giving it to the patient on completion of scheduling their next visit.  This card acts as a data receipt of having been scheduled and reserving a time in the future with the care provider.
